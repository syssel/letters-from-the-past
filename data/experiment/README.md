## Simulate sound change

To test the proposed hypothesis for tracing sound change, we simulate change in the corpora of Parupa and UDDanish:

```
python scripts/simulate_parupa.py
python scripts/simulate_UDDanish.py
```

The code used for extracting and dividing geographical names into temporal bins can be found in the `data/source/danmarksstednavne' directory.
